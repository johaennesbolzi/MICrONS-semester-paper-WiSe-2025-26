# MICrONS-semester-paper-WiSe-2025-26

Dear users,

with this ultimate guide to successfully handling MICrONS, I am trying to make this project more accessible for unexperienced and/or interested people that want to work with the largest connectome to date.
Please note that I am an untrained medical student who did not have any prior experience with coding and programming. I learned the Python basics just for this project and my knowledge is far from perfect. So, in case you have used Python or other languages before, you might find my code too complicated or even find mistakes.
